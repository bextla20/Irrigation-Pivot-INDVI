# NDVI

Calculate irrigation Pivot system by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).

As one of the most popular vegetation indices, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a valuable way to understand vegetation health and land use remotely.
Generally, NDVI is an indicator of vegetation health based on how plants reflect certain ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum.

NDVI was created in 1973 when a research team at Texas A&M University studied data beamed back from earliest Earth observation satellites orbiting the Earth.

The simple mathematical formula (below) calculates the NDVI and, in turn, transforms raw satellite data into vegetation indices.

Healthy vegetation (chlorophyll) reflects more near-infrared (NIR) and green light compared to other wavelengths. But it absorbs more red and blue light.

Sentinel-2 have 13 bands and the necessary bands are NIR and red.

NDVI use in differant area and one of most important area is agricultural. Pivot irrigation rotates on a point creating a circular crop pattern. An important application, among others, in the analysiswith NDVI is related to the estimation of crop coefficient.

In true color, hereâ€™s how it looks for red, green, and blue bands. We say true color because it is the same as how our eyes see.


In this project loaction is part of area Goygol Azerbaijan and use Sentinel images.

There are several sectors using NDVI. in agriculture, farmers use NDVI for predict yield, precision farming and calculate biomass.
