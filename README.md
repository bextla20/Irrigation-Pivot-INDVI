# NDVI

Calculate irrigation Pivot system by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).

As one of the most popular vegetation indices, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a valuable way to understand vegetation health and land use remotely.
Generally, NDVI is an indicator of vegetation health based on how plants reflect certain ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum.

NDVI was created in 1973 when a research team at Texas A&M University studied data beamed back from earliest Earth observation satellites orbiting the Earth.

The simple mathematical formula (below) calculates the NDVI and, in turn, transforms raw satellite data into vegetation indices.
